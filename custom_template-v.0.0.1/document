Install the package github.com/cweill/gotests/... 
Using the commands  go install  github.com/cweill/gotests/… or go get github.com/cweill/gotests/…
In command line run the command gotests [options] PATH …  
            By above command it can generate the go test code
PATH represents the  source code path.


 The Available Options are
              -all    		      generate tests for all functions and methods

	 -excl                  regexp. generate tests for functions and methods                   
                              that don't match. Takes precedence over -only,
                              -exported, and -all

       -exported              generate tests for exported functions and            
                              methods. Takes precedence over -only and -all

       -i                     print test inputs in error messages

       -only                  regexp. generate tests for functions and methods 
                              that match only.Takes precedence over -all

       -nosubtests            disable subtest generation when >= Go 1.7

       -parallel              enable parallel subtest generation when >= Go 
                              1.7.

       -w                     write output to (test) files instead of stdout

       -template_dir          Path to a directory containing custom test code  
                              templates. Takes precedence over -template. This
                              can also be set via environment variable  
                              GOTESTS_TEMPLATE_DIR

       -template              Specify custom test code templates, 
                              E.g. testify. This can also be set via 
                              environment variable GOTESTS_TEMPLATE

       -template_params_file  read external parameters to template by json 
                              with file

       -template_params       read external parameters to template by json 
                              with stdin


We can generate the test files to specific path by using the command

gotests -all -w -template_dir /home/stev/Documents/gotestTemplate  -template_params_file /home/stev/Documents/test.json   /home/stev/Documents/gotests/service/ && cd /home/stev/Documents/gotests/service/ &&  mv  *test.go  /home/stev/Documents/gotests/test/ && cd



 -all  		   	            - It is options in gotests for generate the code all the functions and
 -w   			            -  It is options in gotests for write the all generated code
 -template_dir		            -  It is options in gotests for path which we have customize  
                                                  template folder  . In  Above command  
                                                                     /home/stev/Documents/gotestTemplate  we have the customize                              
                                                  Template folder in that directory
                                                                                                                                                               
-template_params_file           - It is options in gotests for passing external parameters we have 
                                                 Point out the directory where the file is.(must be json extension                 
                                                 file) .In Above Command   /home/stev/Documents/test.json 
                                                                     Specifies  the path of json file in that file we have field we can   
                                                  Use that field in that customize template.
Path[source file path]             - In Above Command the source file will be in this directory                                                            
                                                 /home/stev/Documents/gotests/service/ where we have go file in that                 
                                                 Go code function and method will be for that function and method   
                                                 Will generate test according to template.
&&                                          -  this will add the command it is in bash scrip
cd [path generated testfile]    - In Above command  /home/stev/Documents/gotests/service/ 
                                                                   In this location will the file will generate so that we move to that                       
                                                Path
&& mv *test.go                       - It will move  all the test.go file  in that folder

[destination path]                  - in Above command   /home/stev/Documents/gotests/test/ 
                                                Is the Destination path.
cd                                         - It will come out of that directory.

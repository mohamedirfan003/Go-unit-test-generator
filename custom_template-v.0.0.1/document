 To Generate the Unit Test Generator Follow the steps:

Installation:
              
         Using the commands :
                  go install  github.com/cweill/gotests/… 
                                       or
                   go get github.com/cweill/gotests/… 
           We  can install the package by the above command.

Usage

In the command Line, gotests  can generate Go tests for specific source files or an entire directory.

gotests [options] PATH ...

Path -  the path of Specific Source File.

The Available Options are 

       -all    		                   generate tests for all functions and methods

       -excl                                regex. generate tests for functions and methods                   
                                               that don't match. Takes precedence over -only,
                                               -exported, and -all

       -exported                          generate tests for exported functions and            
                                                methods. Takes precedence over -only and -all

       -i                                       print test inputs in error messages

       -only                                  regexp. generate tests for functions and methods 
                                                 that match only.Takes precedence over -all

       -nosubtests                       disable subtest generation when >= Go 1.7

       -parallel                             enable parallel subtest generation when >= Go 1.7.

       -w                                      write output to (test) files instead of stdout

       -template_dir                     Path to a directory containing custom test code  
                                                 templates. Takes precedence over -template. This
                                                 can also be set via environment variable  
                                                 GOTESTS_TEMPLATE_DIR

       -template                           Specify custom test code templates, 
                                                  E.g. testify. This can also be set via 
                                                  environment variable GOTESTS_TEMPLATE

       -template_params_file       read external parameters to template by json 
                                                  with file

       -template_params              read external parameters to template by json 
                                                  with stdin


      Example:
                $ gotests -only AddEmployee /home/stev/Documents/gotests/service
                              
                             The above command will generate unit test code for specific function
                             We use the -only option near the function Name (AddEmployee).
                             At Last we given the source path or directory of the go file which has the             
                       AddEmployee function in it.
